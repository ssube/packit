## Code Eval

This is a single-agent example where a programmer writes new tools in Python code to complete a variety of tasks, then
uses those tools with prompted parameters.

## Cowboy Story

This is a multi-agent example with a group of agents collaboratively telling a story. In this case, a group of cowboys
are telling a ghost story around the campfire.

## Food Critics

This is a multi-agent example of a panel making binary decisions. A group of food critics are asked to rate dishes and
the results are averaged to determine the final rating.

## Math Tools

This is a single-agent example for function calling models. A variety of math tools and tasks are provided, and the
agent is expected to solve each task using the correct tool or tools.

## Open Ended

This is a single-agent example for creating new tools. A programmer is asked to write some fun code, with a few
restrictions on which libraries can be used, but no specific goal for what the program should do.

## Readme

This is the multi-agent example from [the project readme](../README.md). A group of sailors are asked to tell a
story from their time on the sea.

## Startup CEO

This is a multi-agent example of a team, where a manager is given a goal to accomplish, creates a set of agents to
help them, and then delegates tasks until the goal has been completed. This is a version of the example that made
agentic teams popular.

## String Tools

This is a single-agent example for function calling models. A variety of string manipulation tools and tasks are
provided, and the agent is expected to solve each task using the correct tool or tools.

## Team Tasks

This is a multi-agent example of a team, where a manager uses a group of experts in various fields (programming,
biology, history) to complete tasks. The tasks are distributed between many fields and the manager is responsible for
selecting the best expert for each task.

## Tech Support

This is a multi-agent example where a manager using a text/instruct model asks a tech support agent using a
function-calling model for help with various tasks, using tools available to the tech support agent.
